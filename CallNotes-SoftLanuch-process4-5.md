## Participation Guidelines
- We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Please show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.
- We are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, politics or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.
- We fall under the formal policy and reporting guidelines of the [University Bullying and Harassment Policy](https://edu.admin.ox.ac.uk/harassment-policy) and we expect everyone to be a [responsible bystander](https://edu.web.ox.ac.uk/bystander)

## How do you feel about data sharing? How does your PI feel about data sharing?
-

**Imagine you are a WIN researcher asking "*Can I share my data?*", or "*How can I share my data?*"**

The "decision tree" document and appendices should guide you through the necessary stages to prepare your data for sharing.

**This is not a trivial process, but the purpose of this guide is to help you, not scare you!**

Today we are not writing a "user guide", simply determining whether the plans we have developed will work for you, if we have missed anything, or if there is anything we need to do to support you further.

**You are the ones who will be sharing and receiving credit for your data, so we want to make it easy for you!**

## Feedback on each step

While we're working through each step:
- Do you know how to do this thing?
- Does this flow work for your data?

### Process 4: Metadata

Your shared research data should be supported by additional metadata to make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)). This process helps you identify what metadata will be necessary to make your data FAIR, how to collate it, and how to sufficiently describe it.

Add below any comments about each of the steps in this process.

#### Behavioural and clinical covariates
- comment here

#### Electrophysiological
- comment here

#### Image metadata
- comment here

#### BIDS
- comment here

#### Acquisition protocol
- comment here

#### WIN Open Acquisition database
- comment here

#### Experimental protocol
- comment here


### Process 5: Sharing and attribution

This process describes how to upload your data to XNAT and make it citable. You are also asked to consider whether the standard WIN XNAT Data Usage Agreement (DUA) is appropriate for your data.

Add below any comments about each of the steps in this process.

#### Upload to XNAT
- Who would you like to give internal access to your project? You, your PI and XNAT admin? Your jalapeno user group?

#### Data freeze
- comment here
#### Generate a DOI
- comment here

#### Data usage agreement
- Which statement do you prefer about authorship on papers which re-use your data:
  1. "The data generators shall not be included as an author of publications or presentations without consent."
  2. "Neither the Donders Institute or Radboud University, nor the researchers that provide this data should be included as an author of publications or presentations if this authorship would be based solely on the use of this data."

#### Approve public sharing on XNAT
- How would you like to stage the approval process? Would you like the PI to approve? Email warnings / invitations? Would you like to see a review summary of the de-identification processes completed (e.g. a checklist read from the image metadata)?
- How do you think the access of external users to be managed? Should they have to create accounts? How will accounts be verified (e.g. ORCID or institutional?)? Should accounts be closed after a fixed period?
- What metrics would you like to know about how your data is accessed?
