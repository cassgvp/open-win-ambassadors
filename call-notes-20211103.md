## 3. Introduction to the Ambassadors programme
- Slides: [https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/-/blob/master/slides/wk1-intro.ppt](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/-/blob/master/slides/wk1-intro.ppt)
- Experiences of open science:
    - Exhausting!
    - People can be scared of it. Good to learn it early. 
    - People agree with it, but can be reluctant to open up, especially clincians ("my programming is not good enough!")
    - Common to share within the lab, but making available to the public can bring a fear of competition.
    - If you do share, it needs to be with the intention of others re-using - needs to be understandable. 


## 4. Discussion of our expectations and benefits. 
~~Walk through the [expectations](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/ambassadors/expectations/) and [benefits](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/ambassadors/benefits/) for ambassadors.~~
- ~~What are your initial thoughts about projects you'd like to work on?~~
- ~~Where do you think you'll need most support?~~
- ~~Where do you think you'll be able to flourish?~~
- ~~What rewards/benefits would you like?!~~

Didn't have time for this. Focused instead on the structure/schedule. Move this section to the tools demo day (wk3: 17th November)
