## 1. Wonder orientation
We'll use Wonder this week so we can flexibly make breakouts to work together. 

Come over to Wonder and lets check everyone can:
- Move around (click and hold) and create circles
- Zoom
- Chat (private, circle, everyone)
- Broadcast
- Rooms
- Agree a protocol for when things break! Message on slack or Teams?

## 2. GitLab - Understanding our current skill base
We'll start by establishing who has what level of experience, so we can taylor the training to our individual needs.

<mark>Please fill in the table below to indicate your current comfort level with the tools we'll use for working with GitLab.</mark>

0 = never heard of

1 = heard of but never used

2 = used a little (still uncomfortable)

3 = used a fair amount (mostly comfortable)

4 = used a lot (very comfortable)

## 3. Exercises

We can go through a few different exercises based on our current skill sets.

- Mostly 0-1s => Cass will give a full "OMG what is all this" tutorial
- Mostly 3-4s => Jump into the [issues on Open WIN Community pages](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues) and have a go at those tagged "Ambassadors". 
- Mostly 2s => Chose which of the above groups to join.

What happened: Everyone wants to do the training!
- No-one had all 4
- Insecurity of not knowing what is ahead of us (as amabassadors), so trying to avoid missing smth important
- Wanting to see how other people teach

### Full tutorial
Learning outcomes:
1. Understand why we are using GitLab for the Open WIN community and our documentation. 
2. Learn the main terminology used when working with git
3. Learn how to use the gitlab web interface to fork someone elses repository and make changes to it.

#### Homework
For this session we have worked with gitlab in the online editor. You will later find it is more effective and efficient to work with local versions of a project using a text editor and command line. 

<mark>Complete the below activties to practice working on a local git repo using command line</mark>

1. [Practice using the command line](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/1-1-tools-command-line/)
2. Set up your computer to use git ([check that this is already installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
3. [Set up a text editor (I like atom)](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/1-3-tools-atom/)
4. [Configure your gitlab access](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/2-1-starting-gitlab-account/)
5. Pull a local version of your repo
6. [Edit your repo and push changes](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/2-4-starting-git-basics/)

<mark>We need to think of some homework for mostly3/4 folk! Maybe supporting the others?</mark>

<mark>Please add a few words to each of the sections below so we can improve the experience of others.</mark>
### What worked well?
- Going through the terminology of GitLab.
- getting everyone on the same page (I think that's especially useful for collaborative software tools)
- Wonder is fun
### What surprised you?
- I could publish my own page under open.win.ox.ac.uk domain.
### What would you change?
- 
### What would you like to know more about?
- Page building; build my own site as pretty as the open win community site.
- best way of solving merge conflicts
