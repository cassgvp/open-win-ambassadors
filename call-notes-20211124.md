## 1. Feedback on tools 
- [Call notes from wk3](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/-/blob/master/call-notes/wk3-call-notes-tools-demo.md) ([Live version for editing](https://hackmd.io/tAsz-i9HRkGDofC_iKSWiw?both))
- link to Open WIN tools: https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/tools/
- demonstration of acquisition/protocols, data, analysis tools (tasks not covered yet)
- **focus for us**: 
    - documentation 
    - think about use cases
    - feedback to devolopers
    - (not so much coding under the hood)
- acquisition repository is most complete in terms of functionality
    - maybe best repo to start on
- task repo is functional but misses overall pipeline 
- data repo: many unknowns in terms of policy, ethics, sharing
    - will need decision input
- analysis tools are least developed and may need more involvement / development 
    - e.g. not everyone knows how to use a singularity image



## 2. Our first documentation project
- What shall we work on first?
    - [Aquistion / protcols database](http://open.win.ox.ac.uk/protocols/)
- What do we need to include?
    - guide for using FMRIB VPN
    - user cases
        - people uploading/accessing the protocol, either final version or pilot studies
        - people looking for a protocol
        - both internal WIN members and external users
    - search terms (e.g. name of study/researcher, research institution, keywords of study)
    - feedback form for developers
    - "how to" guide (e.g. how to search)
    - clarification on how to include keywords, protocal description
    - guide on what to do once you have found it
    - maybe replace the download button (currently hard to find)

## 3. Practice editing gitlab repository
- [Issues on open WIN pages](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues)
- Link to aquisition gitlab documentation is at the bottom of [this](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/tools/acquisition/) page under [Edit this page on Gitlab](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/blob/master/docs/tools/acquisition.md).
- Make sure you have Maintainer status for the repository. 
- Go to [the ambassadors repository](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/) and add 2 directories. One called "documentation" and one  called acquisition" with informative commit messages 
    - commit messages are also part of the documentation. have a look at the [commit history of this repo](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/-/commits/master)
- Now clone the repository locally. Some important notes:
    - Windows: Git Credential Manager will appear once you try to clone from command line for the first time asking you to add credentials
    - Mac: ???
    - You will need to set a ssh key. Check out the [relevant tutorials](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/2-1-starting-gitlab-account/)
- Go through a file/directory deletion locally and *add -> commit -> push* the changes to the repository.
