- WIN and RROx submitted written evidence to a UK Government enquiry into research reproducibility across the sector (September 2021. [Our submission here](https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1433/reproducibility-and-research-integrity/publications/written-evidence/?DateFrom=&DateTo=&SearchTerm=&SessionId=&page=2)). 
- Today oral evidence will be presented to the Science and Technology Committee from Dorothy Bishop (Oxford), Marcus Munafo (Bristol, Lead of UKRN) and others. 
- Lets watch the [live broadcast]( https://committees.parliament.uk/event/6466/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) of the evidence while we work! 
- RROx have also set up a chat room for the event (private link to be shared in our meeting)

## 2. Documentation set up for protocols db
1. Get everyone sorted with a local copy of the [Ambassadors repo](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors)
    - Follow the link https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/2-1-starting-gitlab-account/. When creating an SSH key for the local computer (as indicated in the "Creating a key" section in this link https://sharepoint.nexus.ox.ac.uk/sites/NDCN/FMRIB/IT/User%20Guides/SSH.aspx#title11), only need to run $ ssh-keygen -t rsa. Ignore the instructions after "To transfer the public key, use scp..."
3. Review the process of issues and milestones.
