- [Open issues on the community pages](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues) to look at particularly around gitlab guides - please have a go if you have time

### External Advisors Board (EAB)

- Will include a section on Ambassadors - each contribute a few lines about expereince and honest feedback about the programme. What do we want the EAB to help with?
- Cass will email and ask for contributions asap. 

### URL for community pages
- This is not easy to find form WIN Intranet. Cass planning to update intranet for EAB and protocols db launch. 
- When sharing link for commuity pages, use: [tinyurl.com/open-win](tinyurl.com/open-win) (see discussion on [this issue](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues/39))

## 2. Protocols db update
- Documentation is complete. Added gifs.
- Inernal and external guide is all on the community pages
- Two protocols which are now public. 
- Comms will be about promoting uptake internally, but we also need to find people to give explicit feedback on usage guidance.
    - Laurence's group is doing WIPs - **Ask Laurence to encourage his team to contribute**
- Now is the time for all of us to be visibly advocating for use of the protocols db - please chime in!

### DB open issues
- General positive non-specific feedback
- https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/acquisition/win-protocols-db/-/issues/43 
- Logo: As on the community pages. **Cass will need to buy license for noun porject graphic**
- Ownership: What happens when people move, or someone else wants to edit. Suggest that people request transfer of ownership when thay leave, but allow this to be an organic thing. 

### Comms plan
- target audience:
    - internal WIN members
    - radiographers
    - external users
- need to create a comms pack:
    - 3 lines of text plus a link -- to go to departments
    - small image for email signatures 
    - some text for newsletters 
    - 3-4 tweets, including images
- lab meetings:
    - promote within immediate research group (generally about Ambassadors programme plus some details about protocls db)
    - create a slide deck
    - **Cass give slides from WIN Welcome - add to ambassadors gitlab**
- conferences:
    - e.g. OHBM
- messaging:
    - first major deliverable for the Open WIN framework
    - bringing visibility to contributions from others (e.g. radiographers)
    - db as example of WIN as an open, collaborative research institute.
