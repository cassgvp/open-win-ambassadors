## 1. Feedback from lab presentaitons
- Verena oresented protocols db to her lab
- Found it cool 
- Add section about pros and cons for the sequences - suggestion to add this as another part of the database. 
- "The sequence was devloped for this reason..." - how is this different from study aim? 
- Add a bit to the guidance on "limitations of this sequence"

## 2. Responding to feedback (Mountain of Engagement!)
- Discussed how to capitalise on the engagement of folks in Verena's lab.
- Following the strategy of the "[Mountain of Engagement](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/community/mountain-of-engagement/)", we should look to provide opportunities to nudge folks towards participation in our framework, i.e. adding to this reposotory. 
- Also look to demonstrate our values of being responsive to feedback!
- Created issue [#46](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues/46) to log the feedback. Verena to invite Margot to create a gitlab account and comment on this issue.
