## 1. Feedback from lab meetings
- Reminder: Verena presented in her group and received feedback, which we created some new material for, created and issue and tagged a group member.
- Issue: https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues/46#note_14620
- What should we do next? We're greatful for MArgot cerating an account. Don't want to over load her right now, so we'll correct the typos for her and tag here in the reply. 
- Does she mean this page: https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/protocols/protocols_guide_internal-how-1/?
- There are typos all over :). Creating a new issue fid find and correct them. 


## 2. Feedback on Steering Group
- Found it interesting, big technical challenge.
- Felt included in the conversation. 
- There weren't any papers sent round in advance, which might improive the expereicen for others. 

## 3. Feedback on 1-2-1 meetings Cass has with researchers
- Very useful, interesting to see the sorts of questions people have
- suprosed that the questions are quite basic, expected them to be really complicated! 
- Often people want to just have the reassuracen that they're doing the right thing. 
- Question mark about investigating commercial value of code. It's not clear when we need to get HoD approval. 
- **For protocols db we should proabbly add a line "if you are intentding to openly share a custom sequence, please contacts Stuart to arrrange a Tranfer Agreement with Seimens."** Cass created issue.

## 4. Additions to the repo
- Bernd added a quick sesction on mirring to github. Thank you!
- Looked through other open issues, closed [#11](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues/11)!
