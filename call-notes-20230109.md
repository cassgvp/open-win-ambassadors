## 1. Community Pages
### Meet the Ambassadors
- <mark>HOMEWORK: Review the information written about yourself on the [Ambassadors page](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/ambassadors/meet_ambassadors/) and be prepared to update!</mark>
- Add a Hyperlink to your Oxford/WIN/Departement profile page if you have one (ask your Departmental administrator how to create one if you don;t have one already).
- If you'd like to change your picture, please send it to Cass.

### Authorship
- Once you have written something for the commnunity pages, you will be added as an author and it can go on your CV!

## 2. Git and Gitlab
### HackMD github authorisation
- Thank you @Lisa for working out that to use github sign-in for hackmd on Chrome, you first have to log in using a different browser (e.g. Firefox). The github sign in option then appears on Chrome. 
- <mark>@Mohamed, please could you confirm you can edit this doc after signing into hackmd with your github credentials.</mark>

### Understanding check
- Lisa: has used Github for a few years, mostly with the Github Desktop app rather than the terminal. knows how to use the terminal generally (e.g. for fMRI analysis with bash)
- Miguel: have used Github for quite some time, to contribute to some open source projects and some private repositories. Never used GitLab.
- Juju: worked using github, the basic functionalities (forks/commits). 
- 
### Demysitfying presentation
- [slides on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7506318#.Y7vkOy2cZBw)
- All our ambassadors are expereinced with github/gitlab, so we've skipped the demystifying stage!
- We talked about the importance of Licences, acknowledgements, doi, and jekyll pages.
- More resources on this:
    - [Talk on ORCID and dois](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/670399599)
    - [Talk on licensing and IP](https://ox.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f0179661-da46-467b-ab5d-af1000e0468b)
    - See also guides on [licensing](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/repo-license/) and [DOIs](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/repo-doi/) in the community pages
- We should probably make an advanced version of the 'demystifying' talk which goes into these topics :)
- WIN IT GitLab accounts:
    - Miguel @bpz864
    - Lisa @wym003
    - Juju @pfr545, please ask IT to create a gitLab account for you, following [this guide](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/2-1-starting-gitlab-account/) - Actually, I have a computing account already and I was able to connect to the WIN gitlab - Great, thank you!
    - <mark>@Mohamed - what is your WIN IT username?</mark>
