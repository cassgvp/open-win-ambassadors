## 1. Your project ideas

### WIN to the world
- Peter has written a draft of a tweet describing a recent published paper
- Communication priority: 1) Must know; 2) Should know; 3) Could know. Can also use TL/DR.
- Talk to Public engagement ambassadors to see if they'd like to collaborate on "WIN to the world"
    - Public engagement 101 for us? <mark>email Hannah: wanna work with us?</mark>
- Twitter + Monday message: internal/external - different versions?

### Monday Message
- Slack channel: #monday-message
    - joined (Peter)
- How long should it be? - Keep it short.
- Section title "Open Science" might not be attractive to some people
- We don't like "Intranet Highlight"
- Too many words...
- discussion continued on: https://padlet.com/WINPublicEngagement/open-win-ambassadors-2023-projects-monday-message-c83nu0jzncbmvhyv
