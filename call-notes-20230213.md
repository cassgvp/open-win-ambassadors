## 1. Open WIN to the World

- Meeeting with PE and Comms Monday 13th March 12:30 <mark>Cass to see if they can make it to our normal meeting time</mark>
- **Think about what we can do between now and meeting**
    - <mark>Cass to ask what we can do between now and the meeting, e.g. gather examples of materials?</mark>
    - <mark>Create an issue on the ambassadors repository to work on this comms project (e.g. list tasks) - Peter?</mark>
- **What do we want to get from that meeting**
    - Invitation: "conversation about what we’re planning, or perhaps a short “101” on comms/PE? We’re also keen to work with the PE Ambassadors"
    - Strategy?


<mark>Cass follow up with IT about the open@win email address. - in progress. Checking settings so it is automatially added to your outlook rather than having to map it explicitly</mark>

<mark>Mohamed: 
    - Have a look at the issues and select some of them. 
    - Add a protocol to the MR protocols' database and get the DOI for a paper submission</mark>


## 2. Gitlab Training



- "April" training session as part of grad course.
    - Set the scope of what we want to deliver - just git?
    - How long session
- Preference to deliver hybrid [Carpentries-style](https://carpentries.org).
    - See what we already have covered in grad course
- Think about ongoing support
    - Open WIN Slack? 
    - new mailing list?

Continued discussion on [padlet] next week (https://padlet.com/WINPublicEngagement/open-win-git-training-sao9d8r0617estdn)


## 3. Community page GitLab issues

- Juju tried to review issues but had a pipeline error message
    - Need to update the just-the-docs theme, but not sure of the process. Mohammed suggested Will Clarke might be able to help. - Theme now updated by Cass! This was helpful: https://gist.github.com/msrose/2feacb303035d11d2d05 



<mark>Homework: Please all look at the [issues tagged "Ambassadors"](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/-/issues)</mark>
