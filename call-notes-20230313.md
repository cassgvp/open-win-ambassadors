## 1. Setting up HackMD for OPENWIN
- <mark>Peter to try and set this up ready for next week</mark>
    - See [this issue on ambassadors gitlab](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/-/issues/8)

## 2. Preparing for Meeting with PE and comms
- [Our first thoughts on open science comms padlet](https://padlet.com/WINPublicEngagement/open-win-ambassadors-2023-projects-monday-message-c83nu0jzncbmvhyv)
- TODO: see a few sample posts
    - see [this on the ambassadors gitlab](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/open-science/community/open-win-ambassadors/-/blob/master/newsletter/open%20science%20bites.md)
    - change title from OPEN SCIENCE to something specific
        - eg, WIN data managment plans ...
    - <mark>Cass: Update the titles for the Monday-message-type </mark>
    - Distinguish between comms message types
        - WIN2WIN
            - <mark>Cass: move bites to new subheading</mark>
        - WIN2WORLD
            - <mark>Peter to add tweet thing</mark>
- TODO: get a better understanding of who the targeted audience(s) will be for these news items
    - WIN2WIN: audience WIN 
        - specific groups within WIN?
            - students
            - Open Science vets/noobs?
            - PIs
            - ECRs
            - <mark>Cass: Under each WIN2WIN message idea, add the specific target audience within WIN, first thing under the title </mark> (e.g. example 3 could target PIs, 4 more for students/ECRs)
    - WIN2WORLD: people that follow WIN on Twitter etc (Public facing but also lots of WIN people follow). 
        - <mark> ASK comms: do we know the demos of the WIN social media accounts? 
        - audience is more public facing than WIN2WIN
- TODO: what the goals are (e.g. more people using the resources you mentioned?).
    - split goals by target audience
    - WIN2WIN: connect WINners to resources
    - increase OPEN SCIENCE profieciency at WIN
    - highlight successes at WIN
- TODO: example(s) of a prior post(s) on Open WIN that has done well (however you’re choosing to measure that) and you’re hoping to emulate. 
    - see success stories below 
    


## 3. Success Stories Seminars
Speaker ideas
- Tulika Nandi <tulika.nandi@ndcn.ox.ac.uk> (ex postdoc with Charlie Stagg, moving/moved to Mainz) - I know she’s publishing work with some shared data and maybe code?
- Charlotte Rae <C.Rae@sussex.ac.uk>  (ex Oxford undergrad, now PI at Sussex) - publishing all her code and anonymous data)
- Janine Bijsterbosch <janine.bijsterbosch@wustl.edu> (ex Oxford postdoc, now PI at Washington) - my guess is she’s running her whole lab as open as possible. She was in the Analysis group, so she will draw a good/influential crowd.
- Verena Sarrazin (verena.sarrazin@psych.ox.ac.uk) - someone contacted her about using her data
- We could get in touch with people involved in the Open WIN resources' projects like UK Biobank, Human Connectome Project (HCP), Developping Human Connectome Project (dHCP), ... https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/open-win/open-win-resources
- <mark>TODO: set the ‘brief’ for our speakers. Do we want them to talk about their [published] work, or their open science practices, or both? Would be great to keep these to short presentations (e.g. 20 min + 10 min questions) to keep it light.</mark>
- Hesitant on time commitment / workload
- 15-20 min talk + questions 

Where will we host the speakers
- WIN Wednesday
- book on Calpendo to get a room and a time

How to coordinate with speaker
- just email them and give them options for rooms and times
    
Recording
- Andrew does all the recording
- You just need to turn up if you can, speaker might be remote. Talks will always be hybrid 
    
What do we actually have to do?
- organise a time with the speaker
- chair the chat 
    
<mark>Lisa to coordinate with Verena to set up the first Seminar!</mark>
    
    


## 3. Feedback on this session
<mark>Please add a few words to each of the sections below so we can improve the expereince of others.</mark>
### What worked well?
- <mark> Open WIN PE and Comms meeting: </mark>
    - People are on board (Jacqueline and Hanna). 
    - We would use the same twitter account as the PE team (global win twitter account)
    - Discussion about target audiences 
    - using comms and not PE because our audience is mainly academics
