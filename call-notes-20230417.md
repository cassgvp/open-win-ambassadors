## Check-In 

How is everyone doing? 

Because we are in a transition period we have interrogations about the Open Science Ambassador program. 
Interrogations 
- What CAN we do when Cass is not there anymore?
    - Can we organise stuff?
        - We can meet among the ambassadors as much as we want
    - Who should we contact?
        - [Cass' Network](https://padlet.com/WINPublicEngagement/cass-network-ayam61z5ow5odkln)

- Do we know more about this and the person taking over the Ambassador program? 
    - see above

- Direction and plans for group projects
    - Group effort to respond to open win questions

<mark>Please complete the [record a Teams meeting request form](https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/record-a-meeting-in-teams)</mark>


Most important thing for the WIN is answering people that ask about open science.

## 1. Personal plans

This section will conprise the long term plans of every Ambassador involved. These projects will be taken care of whatever happens next. 
- Peter will perform an independant analysis of how the large-scale animal and human electrophysiology databases are being structured.
- Lisa will continue to work on the success stories. She talked to Verena (first presenter). However, Lisa would prefer if the next person in charge of the program (Cass' replacement) takes over a part of the organisation. 
- Mohamed started to work on the protocols database, reviewed the documentation, and asked colleagues for reviews. In addition, he is having regular meetings with the IT team to work on the integration of the data acquired on the preclinical (Bruker) scanner into the XNAT system (for the online access to the data). 
-  Miguel plans on working on the GIT training. However, he is waiting on Cass to confirm this project's advancement.
-  Juju is still planning on submitting behavioural tasks on the WIN gitlab folder. These tasks should be ready shortly.  

## 2. Group plans

- Most Ambassadors expressed their will to start up the social media project: send regular messages/links/tutorials/updates about Open Science on a twitter accound + mastodon account
    - Next steps are just to write some content! 
    - Reach out to comms team / Andrew for Monday message once we have stuff ready to go
- Success stories, what is planned? 
    - Focus on running the first session, decide if we will do any more after that
- GIT training, what is planned? 
    - We should still run something, but at our own pace
    - what would we need to prepare?
        - Cass has already made a [tutorial](https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/docs/gitlab/gitlab-tutorials/)  
        - This is also a good resource: [carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
        - [Gaurav](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/people/gaurav-bhalerao) would be great to have on board as well - UKRN Local network lead for events at Oxford + [SSI Fellow](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/gaurav-bhalerao)
            - <mark>Contact Gaurav about this, Miguel?</mark>
